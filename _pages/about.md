I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. Lap-Pui Chau](https://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~lpchau/) (IEEE Fellow) and [Dr. Yi Wang](https://wangyintu.github.io/). My research interests include image-based 3D perception and embodied artificial intelligence (AI).

I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/)) in 2020 and my M.Sc. degree in Data and Artificial Intelligence from the Institut Polytechnique de Paris ([IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en)) in 2023.
